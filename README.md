## Fractional Step Discriminant Pruning

This repository contains the code for the paper “Fractional Step Discriminant Pruning: A Filter Pruning Framework for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks” (MMC Workshop at IEEE ICME 2020).

## Introduction


Motivated by limitations in recent works and related research findings in shallow learning, we present a new method for pruning deep convolutional networks. Specifically, we extend the previous work [1] on this topic in two ways:
1. We replace the L2-norm-based criterion by: a) a Class-Separability-based (CS-based) criterion, exploiting the labelling information of annotated training datasets [3, 4, 5];
and, b) a Geometric Median-based (GM-based) criterion, as the one described in [2].

2. Similarly to [1] we apply an asymptotic pruning schedule. However, not only the number of selected filters (as in [1]) but also their weights vary asymptotically to their target value.

This implementation extents the implementation of [Filter Pruning via Geometric Median (FPGM)](https://github.com/he-y/filter-pruning-geometric-median) [2].


## Dependencies

To run the code use Pytorch 1.5.1 or later.


## Usage

To run the code for the different datasets (Cifar10, Imagenet, GSC) and ResNet network architectures use the corresponding settings described in the paper.
For instance, for ResNet56 and total pruning rate 50%, with 10% and 40% for the CS and GM criterion, respectively:

python notebook_cifar.py --dataset cifar10 --arch resnet20 --prune_rate_cs 0.1 --prune_rate_gm 0.4 --data_path datasets --save_path snapshots/fsdp-cifar10-resnet20-rate50

python notebook_imagenet.py --dataset imagenet --arch resnet56 --prune_rate_cs 0.1 --prune_rate_gm 0.4 --data_path datasets\ILSVRC2012 --save_path snapshots/fsdp-imgnet-resnet56-rate50 --epochs 40 --schedule 1 10 20 30 --gammas 1 0.1 0.1 0.1 --learning_rate 0.01 --decay 0.0005 --batch_size 128


python notebook_gsc.py --dataset gsc --arch resnet56 --prune_rate_cs 0.1 --prune_rate_gm 0.4 --data_path datasets\gsc --save_path snapshots/fsdp-gsc-resnet56-rate50 --epochs 70 --schedule 50 --gammas 0.1 --learning_rate 0.0001 --decay 0.01 --batch_size 128
